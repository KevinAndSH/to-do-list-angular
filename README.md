# To do List - Angular

Sweet and simple to-do app made with [Angular](https://angular.io).

Made use of features like lifecycle hooks, two-way binding, event handling, Services, Observables in the form of Subjects, Subscriptions, Input decorators, and OOP concepts like dependency injection, private properties and getters.

It has no style at all. I'm gonna add them at some point.
