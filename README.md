# To do List - Angular

Sweet and simple to-do app made with [Angular](https://angular.io).

Made use of features like lifecycle hooks, two-way binding, event handling, Services, Observables in the form of Subjects, Subscriptions, Input decorators, and OOP concepts like dependency injection, private properties and getters.

Translucent glass appearance in the main element achieved thanks to the `backdrop-filter` property, combined with a semitransparent background color, as shown in the following CSS snippet:

```css
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .1);
backdrop-filter: blur(1.2em);
```
